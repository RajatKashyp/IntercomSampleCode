I am excited to share one of my most memorable and proudest moments in professional life. 

When I was recruited as an associate android developer, my team lead helped mentoring me throughout. 
However, after being in the company for just around 6-8 months, I was able to grasp knowledge from outside of my domain (front end). 
I was always dependent on the backend team for APIs and getting desired results.

My proudest moment was when I worked as a full stack developer (frontend / backend) for a project because of limited resources. 
I was not getting allotted with any backend resource as all team members were occupied. 
But the new in-house android project was critical to deploy. I started adding extra time to learn and develop backend queries. 
I learned how to implement Firebase Realtime Database and added firebase analytics to generate reports based on usage. 
This was all new for me, as well as my team as no one has had worked as a full stack developer. 
I learned a lot of new features which were then unknown, I updated my technical skills using Research and Development. 
I learned the importance of documentation and reporting as I was answerable to the owner of this project.

Finally, I deployed the project and since the inception of my project app, 
there was no error/crashes even when number of downloads were more than 10,000.  
I was personally appreciated by the company MD after successful launch of the application.
